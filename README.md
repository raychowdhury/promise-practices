JavaScript Promise & Async Await Practice
This project demonstrates various JavaScript examples involving Promises, async/await, and handling asynchronous tasks such as:

Simulating car orders and product processing.
File upload checks based on file size.
Fetching data from external APIs (like Pok√©mon API) using both Promises and async/await.
Error handling for network responses and asynchronous functions.
Key Features:
Promises: Handling asynchronous operations with then() and catch().
Async/Await: Using modern JavaScript syntax for asynchronous functions.
API Fetching: Example of fetching data from an API with proper error handling.
Feel free to explore, modify, and run the code for learning or practice!
